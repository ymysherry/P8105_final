## Tentative project title

Presidential Election in Pandemic

## Motivation

The COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, and racial injustice have been top
concerns in the 2020 presidential election. According to AP VoteCast, a
national survey of the electorate, about 4 in 10 voters suggest the
pandemic as the top issue while the economy follows behind. However, an
Associated Press analysis gave conclusions with a surprising twist: in
counties with worst COVID-19 surges, Trump enjoyed enormous support. We
are interested in using polling data and data of the COVID-19 case
incidence / death rates to investigate whether and how COVID-19 pandemic
has influenced supporting rate distribution among all states,
particularly in top battlegrounds.

## The intended final products

A website that includes a report of our exploratory analyses, regression
analysis and visualization, and an interactive dashboard.

## The anticipated data sources

  - [RealClearPolitics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/)

  - [An github election project](https://electproject.github.io/)

  - [COVID-19 data by
    states](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/coronavirus/country/united-states/)

## Analyses

1.  Analyses of key states / top battlegrounds (eg: Florida,
    Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Arizona, Ohio,
    Minnesota, Iowa, Nevada, Texas, Georgia, Virginia, New Hampshire,
    Maine, Colorado and New Mexico)

<!-- end list -->

  - Time trend & regression of supporting rate poll in 2020 and COVID-19
    confirm/death rate, stratified by states.
  - Comparison of democratic / republican supporting rate between 2020
    and 2016
  - Supporting rate distribution among mail-in ballots.

<!-- end list -->

2.  Analyses of all states:

<!-- end list -->

  - Compare the COVID-19 death / confirmed case rate distribution in
    blue and red states.
  - Voting rate vs. COVID-19 death rate distribution.

## Visualization:

1.  3 Linear graphs representing the change of supporting rate of
    democratic and republican, and the COVID-19 confirmed/death rate
    respectively on the same panel

2.  Histograms showing the supporting rate of democratic in 2020 and
    2016 and it of repulbican in 2020 and 2016

3.  Pie plot showing the distribution of democratic and republican among
    the mail-in ballots in 2020

4.  Box plot comparing the COVID-19 death / confirmed case among red
    states and blue states respectively

5.  Histograms showing the voting rate and COVID-19 death rate in each
    state respectively.

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

1.  Mail-in ballots (nearly half of the votes) at some of the pivotal
    states have not yet been counted. No winner has been declared in
    this presidential election. Pre-election day polling statistics
    could be confusing as some of the voters do not participate in these
    polls.

2.  The comparison of supporting rates of both candidates between 2016
    and 2020’s election could be significantly different, because the
    number of voters in 2020 are significantly higher than in 2016.
    Sampling population in both years would not be representative enough
    to complete the comparative analysis.

3.  Test-positive rate and case-fatality rate for Covid-19 over time is
    influenced by the seasonal fluctuation and also vary by age groups,
    since older people are more likely to be infected; In addition, more
    testing kits are becoming available after FEMA and state governments
    started to purchase them.
